CronScheduler allows you to run cruisecontrolrb on specific times.

When installed the latest build always gets run on the scheduled time.

It uses the same format as cron:
minutes  hours    mday     month    wday
*        *        *        *        *

Allowed patterns are:
10    = run every 10th minute
1,2,3 = run every 1st, 2nd and 3rd minute
*     = run every minute
*/2   = run every 2 minutes
9-18  = run from 9 till 18
1-9/3 = run from 1 till 9 with steps of 3

For now only minutes, hours and weekdays can be set.

Add it to your config:

Project.configure do |project|
  ...
  project.scheduler = CronScheduler.new(project)
  project.scheduler.cron = "*/15 9-18/3 * * 1,3,5"
end
